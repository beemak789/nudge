nudge 🐙
============
nudge is an iOS mobile application that helps users complete their daily tasks; it provides a list of nearby places where users can purchase their items in order to complete their daily tasks. Users can add friends, join friend groups and chat, as well as create group tasks so they can help one another complete tasks on each of their lists. In addition, the user is able to send and receive notifications from friends, or nudge their friend(s) if they happen to be at a location that carries that item on their list.

Getting Started with nudge 🏁

2. Download Expo Go from the App store to use on your iOS device
3. If you are new to Expo, create an account so you can receive push notifications

**Installation**
1. Clone the repo: git@github.com:2108capstone/capstone.git
2. Install npm packages: npm install
3. Run and build the app: npm run start
4. Scan the QR Code in either the Terminal or Browser to open nudge on your iOS device through Expo Go.

**Logging In**
* The app opens up with a login page; you will sign up as a new user.
* Once logged in, you can add any item, or task to your list. You can mark tasks as complete or incomplete, as well as delete tasks via swiping left or right.
* Once items are on your list, you can find nearby places that sell such items on your list, either in list-view or mapview.
You can add friends, join groups and chat rooms or send notifications to nudge a friend who happens to be at the store that sells an item on your shared lists.


**Navigating the App**
* Tapping on the bottom tabs will take you to different sections of the application.
* Places will take you to view a list of nearby stores that carries your item(s) on your list, as well as see a mapview
* Friends will open a view to add, search and delete friends, as well as make friend requests
* Groups will open a view to create, view and delete the groups you belong to, as well as select friends you wish to add to your group. * * Within a group, you are able to create group tasks, enter a group chat with specific group members and have the option to edit, delete or leave the group. You can also search for stores that may carry the item you are looking for.
* Profile shows your user profile, as well as the ability to turn both your location status and notifications on or off. In addition, you are able to view the badges you have earned as a result of completing your tasks for the day.

Have fun and explore nudge!
