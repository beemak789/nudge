nudge 🐙
============
nudge is an iOS mobile application that helps users complete their daily tasks; it provides a list of nearby places where users can purchase their items in order to complete their daily tasks. Users can add friends, join friend groups and chat, as well as create group tasks so they can help one another complete tasks on each of their lists. In addition, the user is able to send and receive notifications from friends, or nudge their friend(s) if they happen to be at a location that carries that item on their list.

* Once logged in, you can add any item, or task to your list. You can mark tasks as complete or incomplete, as well as delete tasks via swiping left or right.
* Once items are on your list, you can find nearby places that sell such items on your list, either in list-view or mapview.
You can add friends, join groups and chat rooms or send notifications to nudge a friend who happens to be at the store that sells an item on your shared lists.
